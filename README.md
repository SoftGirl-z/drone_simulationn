# 🚁 Quadcopter Simulation (Unity)

A realistic **quadcopter (drone) simulation** developed in **Unity**, focusing on flight physics, control systems, camera transitions, and real-time HUD visualization.  
This project is intended for **educational and simulation purposes**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a quadcopter drone in a 3D environment using Unity.  
It demonstrates how drone flight mechanics, user input, physics, and UI systems can work together in a modular simulation.

The simulation includes manual flight control, propeller dynamics, collision handling, and a heads-up display (HUD) for real-time feedback.
